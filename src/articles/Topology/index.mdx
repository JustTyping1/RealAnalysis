When most people think of mathematics, they think about numbers and unfamiliar symbols
scribbled all over a chalkboard like hieroglyphics. Rarely do we think about visual algebra
or geometry, and even more rarely do we think about the illusive field of topology.
It is one of the most recent fields of mathematics, where the others date back millennia. 
It’s somewhat a subset of geometry and the term was first used in the 19th century by a 
German mathematician named Johann Benedict Listing.

Topology essentially considers objects to be identical if they one can be melted down and
reshaped into the other without closing or opening any new holes. For example, a doughnut
has one hole, so it is topologically the same as a teacup because there is hole where the
handle is. That is to say, if the teacup were to melted down and the number of holes to remain
unchanged, it could be reshaped into a doughnut, or torus. A bottle of orange juice is topologically
analogous to a frisbee. A T-shirt is topologically analogous to a pair of glasses with no lenses.

While this may seem rather simple, topology has actually evolved hugely from this basic principle.
A major advancement in the field came with the advent of topological sets, which are “spaces” in which a
number of elements or “points” can be contained. These ideas have had influence on other fields of mathematics
and also other sciences. For example, knot theory, a subset which focuses on the mathematics of
“knots” has benefited hugely from topology. 

Furthermore, a concept in physics, concerning the nature of time and space, known as “string theory”
is another area in which topology can be applied.

In conclusion, whilst mathematics is often generalized as being a bookish subject and one free
of abstraction, in reality is so all-encompassing that no such generalization can be made. Topology
is a fascinating field full of questions that perhaps may require a different style of thinking,
but this makes them no less mathematical. In fact, it encapsulates the core of the subject, problem
solving and goes to show that there is a whole universe waiting if we just look below the iceberg.
