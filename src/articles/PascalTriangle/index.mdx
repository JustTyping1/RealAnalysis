The true beauty of mathematics is how universal it really is. No concept is a better
demonstration of this than pascal’s triangle. Pascal’s triangle is a concept in mathematics.
It a chart shaped like a triangle in which the first number is 1 and then 2 1s are put
below it like so:
1
1  1
Then, every number is the sum of the two numbers above it (assuming everything outside the triangle is 0),
like so:
1
1  1
1  2  1
1  3  3  1
1  4  6  4  1
These numbers show up frequently in probability calculations, which may be deserving of its own article some point
in the future, but, there is another quite fascinating use to the triangle. For any given expression (1+x)ⁿ, it can
be expanded. For example:

(1+x)² = x² + 2x + 1
(1+x)³ = x³ + 3x² + 3x + 1
(1+x)⁴ = x⁴ + 4x³ + 6x² + 4x + 1

We can now take the coefficients of these terms.

When raised to the 
2nd  : 1 2 1
3rd  : 1 3 3 1
4th  : 1 4 6 4 1
power, and thus, we can clearly see that there is a correlation with pascal’s triangle. This technique was
first discovered by Sir Isaac Newton in the 1600s, and this is now known as a quick shortcut to calculate 
this rather common problem.

Another amazing feature of Pascal’s triangle, is that even though it is named after Blaise Pascal, many other
cultures had discovered this concept far before Pascal. It is extremely striking to see how, even though these discoveries
are written in different languages, we can still make sense of exactly what these ancient cultures were thinking.

Pascal’s triangle is just one of the many ideas through which the limitlessness of mathematics can be seen.
It is absolutely incredible how almost any mathematician can recognise Yang Hui (the Chinese version of
Pascal’s triangle) even though it is in an unfamiliar script. Mathematics has been, quite rightly, been described as
a universal language. It transcends the barriers between us and gives us medium through which to discover and invent.
